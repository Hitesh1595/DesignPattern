# Why Use Singleton?
# Prevents multiple instantiations of objects (e.g., for configurations, database connections).

# Shared state across the application.

# Useful when you want to coordinate actions across the system using a single shared resource.

# Is Django a Singleton?
# Yes, in some contexts:

# Settings configuration in Django is singleton-like.

# The WSGI application object is created once and reused.

# The database connection pool is shared.

# Example: When Django starts, it loads settings and initializes once. All views, middleware, etc., refer to this global state.

# But: Django uses class-based and functional patterns, not strictly Singleton everywhere.





#  Real-Life Handling in Web Frameworks (Multi-threaded or ASGI):
# ðŸ§µ Threads:
# Each request may be handled by a new thread or async task.

# If Singleton is used unsafely, race conditions can occur.

# âœ… Solution:
# Use thread-safe singletons or initialize objects before server starts (e.g., in startup event in FastAPI).

# FastAPI supports lifespan events for global initialization:


class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        pass


s1 = Student()
s2 = Student()

print('student', s1 is s2)
