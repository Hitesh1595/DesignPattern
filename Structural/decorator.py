# Attach new/Existing behaviour to an object

# without altering existing code

# overriding behaviour

# The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows
# you to dynamically add behavior or responsibilities to an object
# without modifying its structure. Itâ€™s useful for adhering to the Open/Closed Principle
# (open for extension, closed for modification).
